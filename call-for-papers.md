Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following: <br>
(a) best practices and overlapping lessons learned from <i>deploying</i> conversational agents and robots;<br> 
(b) <i>design</i> of conversational agents and robots; <br>
(c) <i>methodology</i> and <i>integration</i> of conversational systems within robots; <br>
(d) <i>evaluation</i> studies and practices (whether ``in the wild'' or in the lab); <br>
(e) <i>adaptive</i> or <i>personalised</i> conversational robots; <br>
(f) ethical and legal challenges of conversational robots.<br>

## Submission Information 

We seek position papers that are 3 to 6 pages long, including figures, but excluding references. Submissions longer than six pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed. 

All papers for the conference must be submitted in the same format as HRI papers. As such they should be submitted in PDF format and conform to ACM Proceedings specifications. Please note that we are following the general ACM SIG format (“sigconf”, double column format), not the SIGCHI format. Templates are available at this [link](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) (US letter). In addition, ACM has partnered with Overleaf, where you can start writing using [this link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc) directly (note that this Overleaf document uses the new ACM workflow by default, which is not what HRI is using; to fix this, make sure the document uses the “sigconf” document class, rather than the “manuscript,screen,review” document class that is enabled in the Overleaf document by default).


Admittance to the workshop will be based on the overall quality, novelty, and relevance of the submission, and the organizers' goals of bringing together a set of presenters that can represent the diverse and multidisciplinary facets of philosophy, design, and engineering required for the design of CUIs for and with Robots. We will pay particular attention to under-served regions or universities. Papers should be submitted via EasyChair at[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hrci23](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hrci23) by **February 12th**. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and at least one day of the conference. 

## Publication

Accepted papers will be posted to the workshop website ahead of workshop date and serve as the basis of presentations and discussion at the workshop.
