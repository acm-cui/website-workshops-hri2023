    is an Associate Professor at University College Dublin’s School of 
    Information & Communication Studies. His research lies at the juncture 
    between psychology, HCI and computer science in investigating how 
    theoretical perspectives in human communication can be applied to 
    understand phenomena in speech based human-machine communication. He has 
    published widely on user centered issues in conversational and speech 
    interface interaction, is co-founder of the international Conversational 
    User Interfaces (CUI) conference series and has been involved in a number 
    of workshops on this topic at CHI and Mobile HCI.

    is an Assistant Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology at the 
    department of Industrial Design, with a background in philosophy, digital 
    arts, and HCI. Her research is about morally relevant interactions with 
    technological agents like robots or chatbots. Her work explores how we can 
    explore our moral self-identity through conversations with digital entities, 
    e.g., via acting compassionately towards a chatbot. She has organized 
    workshops at relevant conferences: CSCW '20–'21, IUI '21, HRI '2021, and 
    Philosophy of Human-Technology Relations (PHTR) '20.
